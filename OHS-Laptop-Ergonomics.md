## 🎯 Goal  
Understand how to create a safe, ergonomic workspace when using a laptop, and develop habits that prevent strain, discomfort, and long-term injury.

# 🔍 Research & Learning

## 1. Risks of Using a Laptop Without External Equipment
Working directly on a laptop can lead to:
- **Neck strain** due to looking downward at the screen  
- **Rounded shoulders** from leaning in  
- **Lower back pain** from unsupported seating  
- **Wrist strain or tendon issues** from typing on a low, cramped keyboard  
- **Eye strain** from improper screen distance  
- **General fatigue** from poor posture  

Most issues come from the fact that laptops force the **screen too low** and the **keyboard too close** to the body.

---

## 2. Ergonomic Equipment That Improves Posture
- **Laptop stand**: Raises the screen to eye level  
- **External keyboard and mouse**: Allows neutral arm and wrist posture  
- **Adjustable ergonomic chair**: Supports spine alignment  
- **Footrest** (if needed): Keeps hips and knees at 90 degrees  
- **External monitor**: Ideal for long sessions  
- **Desk with proper height** (elbows at a ~90-degree angle)  

---

## 3. Proper Workspace Setup Adjustments
- Screen top should be at or slightly below **eye level**  
- Screen should be about **an arm’s length** away  
- Chair height should allow **feet flat on the floor**  
- Hips and knees should be at **90 degrees**  
- Keyboard and mouse should keep arms relaxed and elbows near the body  
- Wrists should remain **neutral**, not bent upward  

---

## 4. Daily Habits to Reduce Strain
- Take short movement breaks every **30–45 minutes**  
- Use the **20-20-20 rule** for eye strain (every 20 min, look 20 ft away for 20 sec)  
- Sit upright with shoulders relaxed  
- Stretch neck, wrists, and back throughout the day  
- Alternate between sitting and standing if possible  
- Use Focus Bear’s **movement reminders** to maintain consistency

# 📝 Reflection

## 1. Equipment Changes I Can Make
To improve my ergonomic setup, I can:
- Use a **laptop stand** to raise my screen  
- Add an **external keyboard and mouse**  
- Adjust my chair height for better posture  
- Position my laptop at arm’s length and eye level  

If needed, I may also add a footrest or an external monitor.

---

## 2. Behavioural Changes I Can Implement
- Sitting upright instead of leaning forward  
- Keeping my elbows close to my body  
- Performing posture checks throughout the day  
- Taking regular breaks instead of working continuously  
- Stretching my neck, shoulders, and wrists  

---

## 3. How I Can Remind Myself to Maintain Good Habits
- Enable **Focus Bear movement reminders**  
- Use posture notification apps or desktop widgets  
- Place a sticky note on my monitor with “Sit tall” or “Check posture”  
- Set a short timer to remember to stand or stretch

# 🛠️ Task Completion

### ✔️ Adjusted my laptop setup  
I raised my laptop using a stand and positioned it at eye level.  
I also adjusted my chair height to support proper posture.

### ✔️ Identified posture-improving equipment  
I plan to incorporate an **external keyboard and mouse** to maintain neutral wrist position.

### ✔️ Used posture and movement reminders  
Focus Bear’s built-in movement reminders helped me take breaks consistently, reducing stiffness.

### ✔️ Workspace change / habit implemented  
**I now take structured movement breaks every 30–45 minutes and no longer work with my laptop flat on the desk.**  
This has already improved my comfort and reduced neck strain.
