- Focus Bear does **not** sell data to third parties.  
- User data is used strictly for improving app functionality and providing personalised insights.  
- Personal information must be handled carefully, with access given only on a need-to-know basis.  
- Data must be stored securely and transmitted over encrypted channels.

At Focus Bear, confidential data includes:

### **User Data**
- Email, account details  
- Focus session timestamps and patterns  
- Usage analytics  
- Any behavioural data relating to ADHD or executive functioning  
- Messages or support conversations  

### **Company Data**
- Internal documentation  
- Project roadmaps and code

## 3. Best Practices for Handling Confidential Data
- Store all sensitive files in secure, company-approved locations (Google Drive, Notion, GitHub private repos).  
- Never share personal data through unsecured channels.  
- Avoid downloading sensitive files unless necessary.  
- Do not store credentials in plain text or commit them to repos.  
- Use **environment variables**, encryption, and access controls.  
- Only access data if it is required for a task.  
- Log out of shared or public devices.  
- Follow the rule of least privilege.

## 4. How to Respond to a Suspected Data Breach
If I notice unusual activity, accidental exposure, or a potential breach:

1. **Immediately report it** to my supervisor or security contact.  
2. **Document what happened** (time, file involved, platform, any screenshots).  
3. **Revoke access** if credentials were involved (API key refresh, password change).  
4. **Follow the escalation path** provided by Focus Bear.  
5. Never try to hide or minimise the incident — transparency helps the team act quickly.

# 📝 Reflection

## 1. Steps I Can Take to Handle Data Securely in My Daily Work
- Carefully check what information I am pasting into AI tools or messages.  
- Use secure storage only — no local unencrypted files.  
- Avoid discussing user data publicly or with unauthorised people.  
- Keep personal and work accounts separate.  
- Follow access guidelines and avoid downloading data unnecessarily.  

---

## 2. How I Should Store, Share, and Dispose of Sensitive Information
### **Store**
- Use password-protected or encrypted platforms.  
- Keep everything inside Focus Bear’s official systems.  

### **Share**
- Only with authorised teammates  
- Through approved channels (Google Drive, Slack/Discord DM, encrypted links)  
- Never forward sensitive info externally  

### **Dispose**
- Delete unneeded files using secure deletion (Trash → permanent removal).  
- Revoke permission access once a project is complete.

## 3. Common Mistakes Leading to Data Privacy Issues (and How to Avoid Them)
| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|--------|----------------|
| Copy-pasting sensitive data into AI tools | Sanitize or avoid completely |
| Leaving devices unlocked | Enable automatic screen lock |
| Storing confidential info in personal folders | Use company-approved storage only |
| Using weak or reused passwords | Use strong unique passwords + 2FA |
| Sharing screenshots with visible sensitive data | Blur or crop before sharing |
| Committing secrets to Git | Use `.env` and secret managers |

---

# 🛠️ Task Completion

## 1. Habit or Practice to Improve Data Security
**I will review every message, screenshot, or snippet before sending it to ensure no sensitive information is included.**

This avoids accidental leaks and builds better privacy awareness.

---

## 2. One Key Learning I Will Implement
**I will begin using a password manager consistently to ensure all logins are strong, unique, and protected with 2FA.**

This reduces the risk of credential leaks and improves overall security posture.
