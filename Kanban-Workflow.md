## 🔍 Research & Learning

### 1. How a Kanban Board Works
A Kanban board visualises the flow of work.  
Tasks move from left to right, representing progress from **planned** → **in progress** → **completed**.

It helps teams:
- See what everyone is working on  
- Identify bottlenecks  
- Maintain a steady workflow  
- Improve collaboration and transparency  

Kanban is continuous not divided into sprints—making it ideal for dynamic, fast-changing workloads like at Focus Bear.

### 2. What the Columns Represent
Typical Kanban columns include:

- **Backlog** – Ideas, tasks, or requests waiting to be prioritised  
- **Ready / To Do** – Tasks prepared with enough information to start  
- **In Progress** – Actively being worked on  
- **Review / Testing / QA** – Work awaiting verification or testing  
- **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot progress due to dependencies or issues  
- **Done** – Fully completed and accepted  

These stages may vary slightly depending on the team's workflow.

### 3. How Tasks Move Through the Board
- The developer (or assignee) pulls tasks from **To Do** → **In Progress** as they start work  
- Once completed, the developer moves items to **Review/Testing**  
- QA or another teammate verifies quality and moves it forward  
- Blocked tasks are placed in **Blocked** with a note explaining the issue  
- The assignee is responsible for updating task status, ensuring accurate visibility for the whole team  

Kanban relies on **continuous updates** so the board always reflects the real state of work.

### 4. Benefits of Limiting WIP (Work in Progress)
WIP limits prevent multitasking overload and improve focus. Benefits include:
- Faster task completion  
- Reduced context switching  
- Fewer bottlenecks  
- Clearer priorities  
- More predictable workflow  
- Higher quality output  

Teams are encouraged to finish existing tasks before starting new ones.

# 📝 Reflection

### 1. How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities & Avoid Overload
Kanban ensures:
- I can clearly see what needs attention first  
- Workload stays manageable through WIP limits  
- The team avoids taking on too many tasks at once  
- Blockers become visible immediately  
- Priorities shift naturally as tasks move across the board  

This prevents overwhelm and helps me focus on completing work rather than juggling too many things at once.

### 2. How I Can Improve My Workflow Using Kanban Principles
I can improve by:
- Updating task statuses frequently  
- Avoiding starting multiple tasks simultaneously  
- Breaking large tasks into smaller, trackable items  
- Adding clear notes or checklists inside each task  
- Reviewing the board at the start and end of each day  
- Paying attention to bottlenecks (e.g., too much in “In Progress”)  

This creates smoother flow and reduces confusion.

# 🛠️ Task Completion

### ✔️ Checked the Focus Bear Kanban board  
I reviewed the GitHub Projects board and observed how issues are structured into clear columns, with labels and assignees.

### ✔️ Moved a task through the workflow  
I updated the status of at least one task, ensuring it flowed correctly from **To Do → In Progress → Review/Done**.

### ✔️ Identified a task tracking improvement  
**I will add clearer descriptions and acceptance criteria to the issues assigned to me.**  
This ensures smoother collaboration and reduces back-and-forth clarification.
