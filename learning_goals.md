## 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I always believe in making people’s lives better with technology, and I hope I can become someone who also contributes something positive. Even though I am studying cybersecurity and this internship is about development, I believe that whenever you enter a new field, you get new exposure. From doing hacking all day in the cyber lab to contributing as a Mac app developer is quite new for me, but I do think that by the end of this internship I will learn tools that I wasn’t familiar with before even giving the interview. It feels like being in a deep sea without knowing how to swim, but I am really excited to learn, work in a diverse environment, stay active to complete work before deadlines, explore out-of-the-box ideas, and understand how Mac app developers use Swift and SwiftUI to improve performance. I am really excited to get hands-on experience.

## 2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
I want to strengthen my development skills in a way that connects with my cybersecurity background. Learning how real applications are built will help me understand security from a developer’s point of view, not just from theory. I’m excited to work with Swift, SwiftUI, and Mac app development tools because they are completely new to me. I also want to improve my ability to write clean code, understand software architecture, and learn how development teams collaborate in a real work environment. Overall, I’m looking forward to becoming more confident as both a developer and a security-focused engineer.

## 3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can bring my security-oriented skills to help protect the application from bugs, vulnerabilities, or viruses that could affect overall performance. With my cybersecurity background, I understand how important it is to keep user data safe and ensure the app runs smoothly without any hidden risks. At the same time, I know I am new to Mac development, so I am fully committed to learning more about the tools, Swift, and SwiftUI. I want to grow both as a developer and as someone who can contribute to building secure, high-quality applications.

## 4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I wouldn’t say I am less confident, but if I ever struggle to understand something that feels out of my reach, I will ask for help from my teammates or reach out to Jeremy directly to find a solution for the code or bug. I try to keep myself confident no matter what the task is, but I am always willing to explore more, do extra research, and find a way to solve any challenge that comes my way. Since I am new to Mac app development and the tools I’ll be using Swift and SwiftUI are quite new for me, I want to spend more time learning about them. I would love to explore, experiment, and watch YouTube tutorials instead of wasting time scrolling through reels, so I can improve myself and understand the development workflow better.

## 5. What does success in this internship look like for you?
I believe success means contributing something that genuinely makes people’s lives better. By the end of this internship, I hope to gain new skills and knowledge that will help me serve in the tech industry and create meaningful solutions for future generations. I also want to build strong professional connections, learn from experienced developers, and grow both personally and technically through this experience.
