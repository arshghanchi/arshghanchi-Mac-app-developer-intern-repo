## 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I always believe in making people’s lives better with technology, and I hope I can become someone who also contributes something positive. Even though I am studying cybersecurity and this internship is about development, I believe that whenever you enter a new field, you get new exposure. From doing hacking all day in the cyber lab to contributing as a Mac app developer is quite new for me, but I do think that by the end of this internship I will learn tools that I wasn’t familiar with before even giving the interview. It feels like being in a deep sea without knowing how to swim, but I am really excited to learn, work in a diverse environment, stay active to complete work before deadlines, explore out-of-the-box ideas, and understand how Mac app developers use Swift and SwiftUI to improve performance. I am really excited to get hands-on experience.
