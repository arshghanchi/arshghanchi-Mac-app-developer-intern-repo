## 1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I always believe in making people’s lives better with technology, and I hope I can contribute something meaningful during this internship. Even though I study cybersecurity and this internship is focused on development, I know new fields create new opportunities to grow. During my cybersecurity labs, I spent hours analysing vulnerabilities, doing ethical hacking practice, and troubleshooting systems but I’ve never built a full application from scratch. That gap is exactly what I want to bridge here. 

I remember struggling to understand how an API worked in one of my university projects, but once I asked for help and explored documentation step by step, it finally clicked. I want the same kind of learning experience with Swift, SwiftUI, and Mac app development tools. It feels like being in a deep sea without knowing how to swim, but I am excited to learn, adapt, meet deadlines, and get real hands-on development experience.

## 2. What skills are you most excited to develop?
I want to strengthen my development skills in a way that connects with my cybersecurity background. Understanding how real applications are built will also help me think like both a developer and a security engineer.

For example, in my cyber labs, I often had to analyse broken code or insecure scripts but I rarely had the chance to build these systems myself. That’s why I’m excited to learn Swift, SwiftUI, and how Mac apps are structured internally. I also want to improve writing clean code, understanding architecture, and seeing how a real development team collaborates on features, bugs, and releases.

## 3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I can bring my security knowledge to help protect the app from bugs, vulnerabilities, or performance issues. In university, I completed multiple tasks where I had to identify weaknesses in code and systems including a project where I found an API endpoint leaking unnecessary information. That experience taught me to look at software from a safety perspective.

Even though I’m new to Mac development, I am committed to learning the tools, Swift, and SwiftUI. I want to contribute not just as a developer, but as someone who can think about user safety, data integrity, and overall app reliability.

## 4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I wouldn’t say I am less confident, but I sometimes struggle when I face something completely new. For example, in one of my uni labs, I couldn’t understand a networking configuration, and I had to ask a teammate for help. After discussing it, everything made sense and that taught me that asking for help is not a weakness, it speeds up learning.

Since I am new to Mac app development, Swift, and SwiftUI, I expect similar challenges. But I am ready to ask questions, explore documentation, experiment, and even watch YouTube tutorials instead of wasting time on reels. I want to build confidence in understanding how Mac applications work behind the scenes.

## 5. What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success for me means contributing something real that helps people. I want to end this internship with new development skills, deeper security thinking, and confidence using Swift and SwiftUI. In previous projects, even small contributions like fixing a bug or improving a script felt meaningful, and I want to bring that same impact here. I also want to build strong professional connections, learn from experienced developers, and grow both technically and personally so I can contribute to future generations in tech.
