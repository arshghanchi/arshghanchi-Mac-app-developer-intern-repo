# Company Reflection – Focus Bear

## 1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
There are five main reasons behind the creation of the Focus Bear app, and the first one is to remove distractions from everyday life. These days, everyone struggles with reduced focus, especially because of smartphones and the internet. I personally find myself getting very distracted by social media, and as a young person, constantly watching new movies or exploring the internet often causes me to lose discipline and focus on my studies and internship.

However, Focus Bear helps people like me stay productive throughout the entire day from morning coffee to going to bed at night. It keeps track of all your daily activities and blocks distractions across all your devices, helping you stay disciplined, consistent, and productive.

## 2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear helps solve productivity and punctuality challenges, especially for people with ADHD and autism, by using technology to support daily discipline. It provides tools that help you stay punctual, focus on real work instead of getting lost on the internet, and maintain a structured routine throughout the day. The app also uses AI-powered blocking to prevent access to distracting apps and websites, reducing negative mental and physical impacts while helping users stay more focused, organised, and consistent.

## 3. Why do you think this mission is important?
I believe this mission is important because distractions have become a major barrier to productivity, focus, and mental well-being in modern life. With constant notifications, social media, and endless online content, it is becoming harder for people—especially those with ADHD or similar challenges—to stay disciplined and maintain a healthy routine. Tools like Focus Bear create a supportive environment that reduces digital overwhelm, helps people stay consistent, and allows them to focus on the tasks that truly matter. 

## 4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
If I find myself really occupied with social distractions alongside entertainment like watching a 3-hour movie continuously, exploring new content all the time, and not putting in effort toward things that help me grow into a better version of myself (eating healthy, not getting distracted easily, or not scrolling reels for an hour) it makes my life very annoying. This app reminds me what I am doing wrong in my life; it acts like a mentor that keeps track of my activity and motivates me to work on my future. And there are a lot of new features that make it interesting for me to keep using, since I mentioned that I am used to constantly exploring new content on social media.

## 5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes, I relate to these challenges a lot. I often find myself getting pulled into social distractions, especially movies, reels, and constantly browsing new content online. Even when I know I should be focusing on my studies, internship tasks, or just taking care of myself, it becomes very easy to drift away. These habits affect my routine, my discipline, and sometimes even my mental peace. Because of this, Focus Bear feels meaningful to me. It gives me gentle reminders, keeps track of what I’m actually doing with my time, and helps me stay grounded in what matters. In a way, it feels like having a supportive mentor that guides me back whenever I start slipping into old habits.
