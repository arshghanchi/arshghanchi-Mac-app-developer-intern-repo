## 🔍 Research & Learning

### 1. Common Cyber Security Threats in Remote Work
- Phishing emails pretending to be official platforms  
- Malware delivered through unsafe downloads  
- Public Wi-Fi risks (man-in-the-middle attacks)  
- Weak or reused passwords being compromised  
- Unsecured personal devices used for work  

### 2. Best Practices for Keeping Devices & Accounts Secure
- Keep OS, applications, and browsers fully updated  
- Use strong, unique passwords for every account  
- Enable 2-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Use a VPN when on public Wi-Fi  
- Avoid installing unverified software  
- Backup data securely  

### 3. Why You Should Lock Your Computer
- Prevents unauthorized access  
- Protects confidential company and customer data  
- Reduces the risk of accidental file access or changes  

### 4. Handling Phishing & Suspicious Links
- Check the sender’s email address  
- Hover over links before clicking  
- Never share passwords through email  
- Report suspicious messages immediately  

### 5. What Makes a Strong Password?
A strong password includes:
- 12–16+ characters  
- Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols  
- No dictionary words or personal info  

**Password managers** are recommended to generate and securely store passwords.

### 6. Importance of 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Adds an extra layer of protection  
- Prevents unauthorized access even if the password is stolen  
- Should be enabled on all work and personal accounts
