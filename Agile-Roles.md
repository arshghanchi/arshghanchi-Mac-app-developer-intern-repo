## 🔍 Research & Learning

### 1. Key Roles in an Agile Team & What They Do

#### **Developers**
- Build features and write code  
- Handle integrations, bug fixes, and technical improvements  
- Collaborate with PM, QA, and UX  
- Estimate effort and break tasks into manageable units  
- Maintain code quality and documentation  

#### **QA (Quality Assurance)**
- Test features to ensure they work correctly  
- Identify bugs and usability issues  
- Verify acceptance criteria and maintain test cases  
- Help improve product stability and reliability  

#### **Product Manager (PM)**
- Defines product vision and priorities  
- Writes clear requirements and user stories  
- Decides what gets built next and why  
- Works closely with developers, UX, and stakeholders  
- Ensures features align with user needs and business goals  

#### **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) / Delivery Lead**
- Facilitates Agile processes (planning, flow management, retros)  
- Removes blockers and improves team workflow  
- Ensures smooth flow in Kanban boards  
- Helps maintain team alignment and continuous improvement  
- Not always present in small startups (roles can overlap)  

#### **Supporting Roles**
**Stakeholders**  
- Provide direction, goals, and feedback  
- Often executives, customers, or partners  

**UX / UI Designers**  
- Create user flows, interface designs, and prototypes  
- Collaborate with PM and developers to refine functionality  

**Customer Support**  
- Provides real-world insights into user struggles  
- Helps prioritise bug fixes and usability improvements

## 2. How These Roles Collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum

### **Kanban (used at Focus Bear)**
- Continuous flow, no fixed sprints  
- Roles collaborate fluidly  
- Work moves through stages: *Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Review → Done*  
- No strict ceremonies; communication happens as needed  
- WIP limits ensure developers, QA, and PM are aligned  
- PM continuously refines the backlog while developers pull tasks  

### **Scrum**
- More structured with predefined roles  
- Developers commit to sprint goals  
- Scrum Master manages ceremonies and processes  
- QA tests within sprint cycles  
- PM (Product Owner) works ahead to prepare backlog for future sprints  
- Collaboration focuses on sprint planning, review, and daily standups

# 📝 Reflection

### 1. My Role and How It Contributes to the Agile Process
As an **intern developer**, my role contributes by:
- Building features, fixing bugs, and refining code  
- Communicating blockers early to maintain flow  
- Breaking tasks down into manageable pieces  
- Updating the Kanban board so the team has real-time visibility  
- Testing my own code before passing to QA  
- Supporting continuous improvement through feedback and learning  

I help keep work moving smoothly across the board and ensure that what I deliver meets the acceptance criteria defined by the PM.

### 2. How My Responsibilities Overlap With Other Roles
- With **QA** → I ensure my code is test-ready and communicate test steps or edge cases  
- With **PM** → I ask clarification questions, understand priorities, and provide estimates  
- With **UX** → I implement designs and give feedback on feasibility  
- With **Other developers** → I collaborate on shared components and follow consistent coding practices  

My role intersects with nearly every part of the Agile pipeline, so communication is essential.

# 🛠️ Task Completion

### ✔️ Short Description of How My Role Fits Into the Agile Team
I contribute to the continuous delivery of working software by developing features, improving code quality, and maintaining transparent communication through Kanban. I make sure tasks flow smoothly from "In Progress" to "Done" while supporting the team with timely updates, clarifications, and testing.

### ✔️ Role I Frequently Collaborate With & How I Can Improve Teamwork

**Role: Product Manager (PM)**  
The PM provides context, requirements, and priorities, which are essential for my development work.

**How I can improve collaboration:**  
- Ask clarification questions early instead of waiting until development has started  
- Provide better estimates and communicate delays sooner  
- Share progress updates more consistently  
- Offer technical suggestions that simplify or improve features  
- Confirm acceptance criteria before marking tasks as complete  

Better communication with the PM helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures features align with user needs.
