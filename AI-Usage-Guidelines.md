## 🔍 Research & Learning

### 1. AI Tools Commonly Used in My Role
- ChatGPT and other LLMs for explanations, debugging, documentation drafts  
- GitHub Copilot for code suggestions  
- Grammarly or AI writing assistants for clarity and structure  
- Jira/Notion AI for task summaries and productivity  
- Midjourney/Canva (optional) for design mockups  

### 2. Benefits of Using AI in a Professional Setting
- Faster problem solving and research  
- Improved code quality through automated suggestions  
- Clearer writing and communication  
- Increased productivity and reduced repetitive work  

### 3. Risks of Using AI in the Workplace
- Accidentally sharing confidential information  
- Over-reliance leading to weaker problem-solving skills  
- AI hallucinations (confident but incorrect answers)  
- Biased or outdated information  

### 4. Information That Should **Never** Be Entered Into AI Tools
- API keys, passwords, tokens  
- Source code that is not public  
- Confidential business or customer data  
- Internal documentation, financial data, personal data  
- Any information covered under NDA  

### 5. How to Fact-Check AI-Generated Content
- Verify against official documentation (Google, Firebase, Focus Bear internal docs)  
- Cross-check with trusted sources  
- Test code before using it  
- Ask follow-up questions to evaluate consistency  
- Use your own reasoning instead of blindly accepting results

## 📝 Reflection

### 1. When Should I Use AI, and When Should I Rely on My Own Skills?
**Use AI for:**  
- Brainstorming ideas  
- Learning new concepts  
- Debugging suggestions  
- Writing drafts (emails, documentation)  
- Speeding up repetitive tasks  

**Rely on my own skills for:**  
- Final decision-making  
- Architecture choices  
- Writing secure code  
- Understanding business logic  
- Anything involving confidential data  

### 2. How I Will Avoid Over-Reliance on AI
- Use AI as a *supporting tool*, not a replacement for thinking  
- Solve the problem independently first, then use AI to refine  
- Compare AI answers with documentation  
- Keep improving fundamental skills (coding, writing, design)  

### 3. Ensuring Data Privacy While Using AI
- Never paste internal code, tokens, or customer data  
- Use sanitized/simplified examples when asking for help  
- Use company-approved AI tools whenever possible  
- Double-check prompts before sending

## 🛠️ Task Completion

### 1. Task Improved Using an AI Tool
I used AI to improve the formatting and clarity of a Markdown document.  
AI helped:  
- Format tables  
- Improve section clarity  
- Fix headings and structure  

### 2. Review of AI-Generated Output
- Required minor editing for accuracy  
- Adjusted tone and formatting manually  
- Verified facts using official sources  

### 3. Best Practice I Will Follow When Using AI Tools
**I will always sanitize sensitive information before using AI and verify all AI-generated content against official documentation before relying on it.**
