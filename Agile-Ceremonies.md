## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 1. Main Agile Ceremonies & Their Purpose

#### **Daily Stand-ups**
- A short, focused meeting (usually 5–15 minutes).  
- Team members share:
  - What they worked on yesterday  
  - What they plan to work on today  
  - Any blockers  
- Keeps everyone aligned and aware of progress and dependencies.

---

#### **Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)**

**Sprint Planning (Scrum)**  
- Happens at the start of each sprint (1–2 weeks).  
- Team commits to a set of tasks based on velocity.  
- Defines sprint goals and workload.

**Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)**  
- No sprints, no fixed timeboxes.  
- PM continuously reprioritises tasks based on user needs and deadlines.  
- Developers pull tasks when ready, rather than committing to a batch.  
- More flexible and ideal for teams like Focus Bear.

---

#### **Retrospectives**
- A recurring ceremony (end of sprint or monthly in Kanban).  
- Team reflects on:
  - What went well  
  - What didn’t  
  - What can be improved  
- Helps improve workflow and collaboration continuously.

---

#### **Backlog Refinement**
- PM and developers clarify requirements, update user stories, and prioritise tasks.  
- Ensures upcoming tasks are well-defined, preventing confusion or delays.  
- In Kanban, refinement is done continuously rather than on a schedule.

### 2. How Agile Teams Collaborate Asynchronously & Across Time Zones
- Use Kanban boards for full visibility of task status  
- Share written updates instead of relying solely on meetings  
- Use tools like Slack/Discord, GitHub, documentation, Notion, Loom, etc.  
- Record meetings for people who cannot attend  
- Provide clear acceptance criteria and detailed notes  
- Tag teammates with actionable, informative messages  
- Keep communication structured and concise to avoid misunderstandings  

Async collaboration is essential in distributed teams like Focus Bear.

# 📝 Reflection

### 1. How Agile Ceremonies Help With Communication & Alignment
Agile ceremonies help by:
- Ensuring everyone knows what others are working on  
- Making blockers visible early  
- Creating predictable opportunities for feedback  
- Encouraging continuous improvement  
- Keeping priorities aligned between PM, developers, and QA  
- Reducing confusion and miscommunication  

They act as regular checkpoints that keep the entire team moving in the same direction.

### 2. Most Important Ceremony for My Role & Why
**Daily stand-ups** are the most important for my role because:
- They help me communicate blockers early  
- I understand team priorities better  
- I stay accountable for daily progress  
- It reduces delays because teammates can spot dependencies or issues quickly  
- It helps me stay aligned with PM expectations  

Stand-ups give rapid feedback and ensure I don’t work in isolation or go off track.

# 🛠️ Task Completion

### ✔️ Attended a Stand-up Meeting  
I observed how team members shared concise updates and highlighted blockers.  
I also noticed how stand-ups help everyone adjust priorities instantly.

---

### ✔️ Participated in a Retrospective / Reviewed Past Notes  
Retrospectives highlighted:
- The importance of communication consistency  
- How small improvements compound over time  
- Team openness and psychological safety  

This helped me understand how improvement culture works at Focus Bear.

---

### ✔️ Documented One Change to Improve My Collaboration  
**I will provide more consistent written updates each day, especially when working asynchronously.**  
This ensures the team always knows what I’m working on, even if we’re not online at the same time.
