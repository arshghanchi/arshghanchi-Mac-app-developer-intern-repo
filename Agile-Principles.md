# 📌 Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks  

## 🔍 Research & Learning

### 1. What Is Agile, and How Does It Differ From Traditional Project Management?
**Agile** is an iterative, flexible approach to software development focused on delivering value quickly and adapting to change.  
**Traditional project management (Waterfall)** works in fixed, sequential phases—requirements → design → development → testing → delivery.

**Key differences:**

| Agile | Traditional (Waterfall) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Iterative and incremental | Linear and sequential |
| Welcomes change | Resistant to change |
| Continuous feedback | Feedback mainly at end |
| Early and frequent delivery | Delivery only at final stage |
| Collaborative and adaptive | Structured and documentation-heavy |

Agile prioritises adaptability, customer value, and continuous improvement.

### 2. Core Values & Principles of Agile (Agile Manifesto)
**Values:**
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
- **Responding to change** over following a fixed plan  

**Key principles that stand out include:**
- Deliver working software frequently  
- Welcome changing requirements  
- Maintain a sustainable pace  
- Close collaboration between developers and stakeholders  
- Continuous reflection and improvement

### 3. Differences Between Scrum and Kanban
**Scrum**
- Works in **time-boxed sprints** (usually 1–2 weeks)  
- Roles include **Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team**  
- Ceremonies: sprint planning, sprint review, retrospective, daily standups  
- A backlog is planned into each sprint  
- More structured and ritual-based  

**Kanban**
- No fixed sprints **continuous flow**  
- Focuses on **visualising work**, limiting WIP (Work In Progress)  
- No strict roles or ceremonies required  
- Tasks move through the workflow at their own pace  
- Highly adaptable and great for variable workloads

### 4. Why Focus Bear Leans Toward Kanban
Focus Bear prefers **Kanban** because:
- Work varies daily/weekly and doesn’t fit neatly into 2-week sprint boxes  
- Small team = simpler workflow with fewer compulsory meetings  
- Continuous improvement and fast response to changes suits the company’s style  
- Kanban reduces overhead and allows the team to stay flexible and focused

# 📝 Reflection

### 1. Biggest Benefits and Challenges of Agile

#### **Benefits**
- Faster delivery of features  
- Ability to pivot when requirements change  
- Better team collaboration  
- Continuous feedback improves product quality  
- Visibility of workload and priorities  

#### **Challenges**
- Requires discipline to maintain flow  
- Can feel chaotic without good communication  
- Frequent context switching if not managed well  
- Difficult for beginners to estimate or prioritise effectively

### 2. How Agile Principles Improve My Role
Agile helps me by:
- Encouraging **constant communication** and clarity  
- Giving me the freedom to ask questions early and avoid blockers  
- Helping me break big tasks into small, manageable pieces  
- Allowing me to improve incrementally rather than waiting for a “perfect” solution  
- Supporting quicker learning through continuous feedback  

Using Agile thinking means I stay adaptable, organised, and aligned with real user needs.

# 🛠️ Task Completion

### 1. Scrum vs Kanban (Summary in My Own Words)
- **Scrum** is like working in organised “cycles” called sprints where you commit to a fixed set of tasks. It’s structured, role-based, and includes regular planning and review rituals.  
- **Kanban** is a continuous flow system with no fixed time cycles. You simply move tasks across a visual board, limit how many you work on at once, and keep improving the process.  
Kanban is more flexible and better for constant change; Scrum works best when planning cycles are predictable.

---

### 2. Agile Principle I Find Most Useful
**“Responding to change over following a plan.”**

This principle will help me stay flexible, adapt quickly, and not get stuck when requirements or priorities shift. It encourages me to focus on progress rather than perfection and to handle unexpected changes confidently.
