## 1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
To be honest, I haven’t explored every single feature in Focus Bear yet, but from what I’ve seen so far, it feels different from other productivity apps like Freedom, Cold Turkey, Tiimo, or Routinery. Most apps only focus on blocking distractions or creating routines, but Focus Bear does both together in a very simple way. It guides you through your day step by step, keeps track of your habits, and reminds you to stay consistent instead of just shutting down apps. The routines, focus sessions, quick breaks, and the “super strict mode” make it feel more like a personal coach rather than just a blocking tool. Even without using all features yet, I can already see that Focus Bear tries to help build long-term discipline, not just temporary productivity.

## 2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
If I were a user, I would choose Focus Bear because it feels more personal and supportive compared to other productivity apps. Most apps only block distractions or only help with routines, but Focus Bear does both in one place. It actually guides me through my habits, shows my progress, and reminds me what I should be doing next. The focus timer, quick breaks, and routines make the whole day feel structured instead of overwhelming. It also feels easier to use — the design is clean, and everything is explained clearly. Overall, I would choose Focus Bear because it feels less like a strict blocking tool and more like a friendly coach that helps me stay consistent, productive, and organised.

## 3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
There are three features that are other apps have that we shoud keep in mind and will be much better if we implemnt that in our app too:

1. Detailed time analytics (like RescueTime):  
   Shows exactly where your time goes with graphs and weekly reports.

2. Full calendar integration (like Tiimo):  
   Lets users connect their Google or Apple Calendar to manage tasks and routines in one place.

3. Windows/Android support (like Freedom or Cold Turkey):  
   Many competitors work across all devices, while Focus Bear is currently more focused on iOS and Mac.

## 4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
One improvement Focus Bear could make is adding more detailed analytics and reports so users can see exactly how they spend their time. Apps like Freedom or RescueTime show clear charts, usage patterns, and weekly summaries that help users understand their habits better. Focus Bear already does a great job with routines and blocking distractions, but having deeper insights and visual reports would make it even more useful, especially for people who want to track their progress long-term.
